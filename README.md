# DS-Nanodegree-Project-1
Project about writing a data science blog spot

## Installation

The code uses Minconda (similar to Anaconda) and the libraries which are already installed in it

## Motivation

The point of interest in this project is around Seattle Airbnb data from 2009 to 2015 which I will use in order to investigate on the following:

1. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle and how does this reflect on prices.
2. If there is a relationship between new listings and the demand over the years
3. What are the main factors that affect the price of a listing
