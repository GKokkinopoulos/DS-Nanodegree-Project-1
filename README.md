# DS-Nanodegree-Project-1
Project about writing a data science blog spot

## Installation

The code uses Minconda (similar to Anaconda) and the libraries which are already installed in it

## Motivation

The point of interest in this project is around Seattle Airbnb data from 2009 to 2015 which I will use in order to investigate on the following:

1. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle and how does this reflect on prices.
2. If there is a relationship between new listings and the demand over the years
3. What are the main factors that affect the price of a listing

The files I used for this project were retrieved by Kaggle (Seattle Airbnb Open Data)

## File description

There is one notebook here which was used to explore through the data and answer the questions set above. There are comments throughout this code to help the reader understand the logic behind this code and the interpretation of the results

## Results

The findings of this investigation have been posted in Medium. Please see link here:
